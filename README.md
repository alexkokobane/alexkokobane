- 🛍 🛒 I subsequently pivoted to building [Shopify](https://github.com/shopify) apps, where I built and listed an app on the [Shopify App Store](https://appstore.shopify.com/windfall).

### What I'm cureently working on
- 🎥 🎞 I'm building [Screen List](https://github.com/screenlist), a platform that collects and presents South African cinema to the public for easy accessibility and preservation purposes.
